# stats_tutorial
A gentle tutorial to essential concepts in statistics.

I try to present the concepts in a fun and interactive way and I encourage you to play with the code to get a better grasp of the concepts.

This notebook is also available as a [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/carlolepelaars/statistics-tutorial).
